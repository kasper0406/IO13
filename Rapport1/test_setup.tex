All measurements presented in this report were performed on a computer
with an Intel Core i3-380UM CPU with the following technical
specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 cores operating at 1.33GHz.
\item 2 x 32KB L1 data cache. 2 x 256 KB L2 cache. Shared 3MB L3 cache.
\end{itemize}
The main memory size of the machine was 1 GB (with 600 - 700 MB free memory), and was running Ubuntu
Linux 12.04. The hard drive was a USB2 attached Fujitsu MJA2250BH which has the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item 250GB
\item 5,400 RPM
\item 8MB cache
\item 512B sector size
\end{itemize}

The file system had a block size of 4096B.

All implementations have been
written in C++11 and compiled on Linux using the GCC 4.7 compiler. When measurements were performed, the
code was compiled using the \texttt{-O3 -flto -funroll-loops}
optimization flags.

In the beginning we ran our tests 3 times. However, to make it feasible
to run our tests on bigger inputs, we adjusted our tests to only
one trial for large inputs.
