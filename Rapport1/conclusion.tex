In the course of the project, four different stream implementations
have been made and tested with an eye to the application of external
merge sort. It was possible to single out a winner among the
implemented streams, which was found it to be buffered streams with
2MB of buffer size.

It was found that the implemented external Mergesort tremendously
improved the performance of sorting large input, compared to
conventional main memory sorting algorithms -- for sorting 1GB of
integer elements, we found a performance increase of a factor $\approx
2.3$, which is significantly bigger for larger inputs.

The overall findings of this project was therefore in agreement with
what should be expected from the I/O-model for analyzing
algorithms. Especially our tests varying the parameters for sorting
shows that I/O is the bottleneck for the running time. We have also
found a way to choose the parameters, which will minimize the I/O for
a given input size.
