In the course of the project, four different stream implementations
have been made and tested with an eye to the application of external
merge sort. It was possible to single out a winner among the
implemented streams, which was found it to be buffered streams with
2MB of buffer size.

It was found that the implemented external Mergesort tremendously improved the
performance of sorting large input, compared to conventional main
memory sorting algorithms -- for sorting 1GB of integer elements, we
found a performance increase of a factor\todo{insert impressive
  factor. + ~algoritme + ved 2GB var heap/qsort absurd langsomt}.

The overall findings of this project was therefore in agreement with
what should be expected from the I/O-model for analyzing algorithms.
