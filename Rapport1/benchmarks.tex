\subsection{Test setup}

Our program was written in C/C++ and compiled with GCC. All memory allocations were cache line boundary aligned. For parallelization we used C++11 cross-platform library \texttt{<thread>}.

All benchmarks were performed on a Linux desktop which has 16 GB ram and a Core i7 3770 CPU with the following specification:

\begin{itemize}
\item 4 * 3.4 GHz (Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz)
\item 4 * 32 kB L1 instruction cache
\item 4 * 32 kB L1 data cache (write back)
\item 4 * 256 kB L2 cache (write back)
\item Hyper-Threading
\item Shared 8 MB L3 cache (inclusive, write back)
\item 64 byte cache lines
\item The associativity for the cache levels are 8, 8 and 16 respectively

\end{itemize}

L2 cache faults, L3 cache faults and retired instructions were measured using Intel Performance Monitor Counter.

The data in the matrices were randomly generated double precision floating points with
an uniform distribution. The range of the data was -1 to
1.
