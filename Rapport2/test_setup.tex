All measurements presented in this report were performed on a computer
with an Intel Core i3-380UM CPU with the following technical
specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 cores w/HT operating at 1.33 GHz
\item 2 x 32 kB L1 data cache
\item 2 x 256 kB L2 cache
\item Shared 3 MB L3 cache
\end{itemize}
The main memory size of the machine was 1 GB (with approximately 600 MB free memory), and the machine was running Ubuntu
Linux 12.04. The hard drive was an USB2 attached Fujitsu MJA2250BH which had the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item 250 GB
\item 5,400 RPM
\item 8 MB cache
\item 512 B sector size
\end{itemize}

The file system had a block size of 4096 B and 128 kB read ahead.

All implementations have been
written in C++11 and compiled on Linux using the GCC 4.7 compiler. The
code was compiled using the \texttt{-O3 -flto -funroll-loops}
optimization flags.

All tests have been performed with uniform distributed random generated 32 bit integers. The variations between several runs were insignificant so we choose to run all tests once in order to run as many configurations as possible.

We measured I/Os with \texttt{/proc/diskstats} and before each test we ran \texttt{sync()}, forcing a write of dirty buffers in the block buffer cache out to disk.
