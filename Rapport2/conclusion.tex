The report shows that external heapsort is slower than external mergesort which makes it less suitable for sorting. 
However, it is only a small factor from external mergesort which indicates that it can be used as an external priority queue with reasonable performance. Its drawbacks as a priority queue is its lack of a 'decrease key' operation and its amortized time bound as opposed to worse case bounds.
