\subsection{Sift algorithm variations}
As described in Section~\ref{sec:heap:sifting} two different strategies for sifting have been implemented. The one uses $\leq V$ space and reads/writes backwards, whereas the other requires $\leq 2V$ space but only reads forwards.

We choose to do a small experiment\todo{More details about the test?} for all our streams with these two sifting implementations, as we were unsure about the penalty (if any) obtained by doing IO backwards.

Doing the tests it was found that the space efficient implementation consistently had a better running time\todo{Decribe how much better?}. Hence this has been chosen for all the following experiments.
